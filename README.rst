=====================
Viet Nam province API
=====================

Homepage: https://provinces.open-api.vn

This is online tool to let my VietnamProvinces_ library reach more users. VietnamProvinces_ is a Python library, so it can only be used in Python application.
By building an online tool on top of it, I hope to help Viet Nam standard data reach more application developers, easpecially web frontend application, where inclusion of big JSON file is not an optimized option.
In the end, it can help businesses collaborate better (by using the same standard data) and benefit people.


The online tool is built to run on Vercel platform, so that I don't have to pay for infrastructure, because this tool is FREE to use.
